# Top dog Angular

Top dog Angular is a front end for [Top dog](https://github.com/FredricLaestander/topdog).
Top dog lets you easily create tierlists, a classification system that allows you to organize anything into ranked lists. Once finished you will be able to share your tier list with the public where friends and others can view your interesting takes and have a good laugh.

## How do i contribute?

### Starting the project

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name -s -t --skip-tests=true
```

`s`: Alias for `inline-style`

`t`: Alias for `inline-template`

`skip-tests`: Skip the generation of unit test files `spec.ts`

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
